# Getting started
To run the program first clone the Github repository using ```git clone https://github.com/rezw4n/Kartoza.git```

Then move to the cloned directory using ```cd Kartoza``` and create a virtual env using ```python -m venv venv```

Note: Python 3.11 was used to create this program but you need to have at least Pythoon 3.7 to run the program properly. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "python.org").

Activate the created virtual environment using ```venv\Scripts\activate``` if you're using windows and ```source venv/bin/activate``` if you're using Mac or Linux.

Install the required package via pip with ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` and then run ```python manage.py runserver``` to run the Django website.
